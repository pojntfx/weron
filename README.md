## Overview

weron provides lean, fast & secure overlay networks based on WebRTC.

It enables you to:

- **Access nodes behind NAT**: Because weron uses WebRTC to establish connections between nodes, it can easily traverse corporate firewalls and NATs using STUN, or even use a TURN server to tunnel traffic. This can be very useful to for example SSH into your homelab without forwarding any ports on your router.
- **Secure your home network**: Due to the relatively low overhead of WebRTC in low-latency networks, weron can be used to secure traffic between nodes in a LAN without a significant performance hit.
- **Join local nodes into a cloud network**: If you run for example a Kubernetes cluster with nodes based on cloud instances but also want to join your on-prem nodes into it, you can use weron to create a trusted network.
- **Bypass censorship**: The underlying WebRTC suite, which is what popular videoconferencing tools such as Zoom, Teams and Meet are built on, is hard to block on a network level, making it a valuable addition to your toolbox for bypassing state or corporate censorship.
- **Write your own peer-to-peer protocols**: The simple API makes writing distributed applications with automatic reconnects, multiple datachannels etc. easy.

## Tutorial

> TL;DR: Join a layer 3 (IP) overlay network on the hosted signaling server with `sudo weron vpn ip --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --ips 2001:db8::1/32,192.0.2.1/24` and a layer 2 (Ethernet) overlay network with `sudo weron vpn ethernet --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey`

### 1. Start a Signaling Server with `weron signaler`

The signaling server connects peers with each other by exchanging connection information between them. It also manages access to communities through the `--password` flag of clients and can maintain persistent communities even after all peers have disconnected.

While it is possible and reasonably private (in addition to TLS, connection information is encrypted using the `--key` flag of clients) to use the hosted signaling server at `wss://weron.up.railway.app/`, hosting it yourself has many benefits, such as lower latency and even better privacy.

The signaling server can use an in-process broker with an in-memory database or Redis and PostgreSQL; for production use the latter configuration is strongly recommended, as it allows you to easily scale the signaling server horizontally. This is particularly important if you want to scale your server infrastructure across multiple continents, as intra-cloud backbones usually have lower latency than residential connections, which reduces the amount of time required to connect peers with each other.

It should now be reachable on `ws://localhost:1337/`.

To use it in production, put this signaling server behind a TLS-enabled reverse proxy such as [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io/). You may also either want to keep `API_PASSWORD` empty to disable the management API completely or use OpenID Connect to authenticate instead; for more information, see the [signaling server reference](#signaling-server). You can also embed the signaling server in your own application using it's [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcsgl).

### 2. Manage Communities with `weron manager`

While it is possible to create ephemeral communities on a signaling server without any kind of authorization, you probably want to create a persistent community for most applications. Ephemeral communities get created and deleted automatically as clients join or leave, persistent communities will never get deleted automatically. You can manage these communities using the manager CLI.

If you want to work on your self-hosted signaling server, first set the remote address:

```shell
$ export WERON_RADDR='http://localhost:1337/'
```

Next, set the API password using the `API_PASSWORD` env variable:

```shell
$ export API_PASSWORD='myapipassword'
```

If you use OIDC to authenticate, you can instead set the API password using [goit](https://github.com/pojntfx/goit) like so:

```shell
$ export OIDC_CLIENT_ID='Ab7OLrQibhXUzKHGWYDFieLa2KqZmFzb' OIDC_ISSUER='https://pojntfx.eu.auth0.com/' OIDC_REDIRECT_URL='http://localhost:11337'
$ export API_KEY="$(goit)"
```

If we now list the communities, we see that none currently exist:

```shell
$ weron manager list
id,clients,persistent
```

We can create a persistent community using `weron create`:

```shell
$ weron manager create --community mycommunity --password mypassword
id,clients,persistent
mycommunity,0,true
```

It is also possible to delete communities using `weron delete`, which will also disconnect all joined peers:

```shell
$ weron manager delete --community mycommunity
```

For more information, see the [manager reference](#manager). You can also embed the manager in your own application using its [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcmgr).

### 3. Test the System with `weron chat`

If you want to work on your self-hosted signaling server, first set the remote address:

```shell
$ export WERON_RADDR='ws://localhost:1337/'
```

The chat is an easy way to test if everything is working correctly. To join a chatroom, run the following:

```shell
$ weron chat --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --names user1,user2,user3 --channels one,two,three
```

On another peer, run the following (if your signaling server is public, you can run this anywhere on the planet):

```shell
$ weron chat --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --names user1,user2,user3 --channels one,two,three
.wss://weron.up.railway.app/
user2!
+user1@one
+user1@two
+user1@three
user2>
```

You can now start sending and receiving messages or add new peers to your chatroom to test the network.

For more information, see the [chat reference](#chat). You can also embed the chat in your own application using its [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcchat).

### 4. Measure Latency with `weron utility latency`

An insightful metric of your network is its latency, which you can measure with this utility; think of this as `ping`, but for WebRTC. First, start the latency measurement server like so:

```shell
$ weron utility latency --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --server
```

On another peer, launch the client, which should start measuring the latency immediately; press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> to stop it and get the total statistics:

```shell
$ weron utility latency --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey
# ...
128 B written and acknowledged in 110.111µs
128 B written and acknowledged in 386.12µs
128 B written and acknowledged in 310.458µs
128 B written and acknowledged in 335.341µs
128 B written and acknowledged in 264.149µs
^CAverage latency: 281.235µs (5 packets written) Min: 110.111µs Max: 386.12µs
```

For more information, see the [latency measurement utility reference](#latency-measurement-utility). You can also embed the utility in your own application using its [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcltc).

### 5. Measure Throughput with `weron utility throughput`

If you want to transfer large amounts of data, your network's throughput is a key characteristic. This utility allows you to measure this metric between two nodes; think of it as `iperf`, but for WebRTC. First, start the throughput measurement server like so:

```shell
$ weron utility throughput --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --server
```

On another peer, launch the client, which should start measuring the throughput immediately; press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> to stop it and get the total statistics:

```shell
$ weron utility throughput --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey
# ...
97.907 MB/s (783.253 Mb/s) (50 MB read in 510.690403ms)
64.844 MB/s (518.755 Mb/s) (50 MB read in 771.076908ms)
103.360 MB/s (826.881 Mb/s) (50 MB read in 483.745832ms)
89.335 MB/s (714.678 Mb/s) (50 MB read in 559.692495ms)
85.582 MB/s (684.657 Mb/s) (50 MB read in 584.233931ms)
^CAverage throughput: 74.295 MB/s (594.359 Mb/s) (250 MB written in 3.364971672s) Min: 64.844 MB/s Max: 103.360 MB/s
```

For more information, see the [throughput measurement utility reference](#throughput-measurement-utility). You can also embed the utility in your own application using it's [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcthr).

### 6. Create a Layer 3 (IP) Overlay Network with `weron vpn ip`

If you want to join multiple nodes into an overlay network, the IP VPN is the best choice. It works similarly to i.e. Tailscale/WireGuard and can either dynamically allocate an IP address from a CIDR notation or statically assign one for you. On Windows, make sure to install [TAP-Windows](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/) first. Also note that due to technical limitations, only one IPv4 or IPv6 network and only one VPN instance at a time is supported on Windows; on macOS, only IPv6 networks are supported and IPv4 networks are ignored. To get started, launch the VPN on the first peer:

```shell
$ sudo weron vpn ip --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --ips 2001:db8::1/64,192.0.2.1/24
{"level":"info","addr":"wss://weron.up.railway.app/","time":"2022-05-06T22:20:51+02:00","message":"Connecting to signaler"}
{"level":"info","id":"[\"2001:db8::6a/64\",\"192.0.2.107/24\"]","time":"2022-05-06T22:20:56+02:00","message":"Connected to signaler"}
```

On another peer, launch the VPN as well:

```shell
$ sudo weron vpn ip --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey --ips 2001:db8::1/64,192.0.2.1/24
{"level":"info","addr":"wss://weron.up.railway.app/","time":"2022-05-06T22:22:30+02:00","message":"Connecting to signaler"}
{"level":"info","id":"[\"2001:db8::b9/64\",\"192.0.2.186/24\"]","time":"2022-05-06T22:22:36+02:00","message":"Connected to signaler"}
{"level":"info","id":"[\"2001:db8::6a/64\",\"192.0.2.107/24\"]","time":"2022-05-06T22:22:36+02:00","message":"Connected to peer"}
```

You can now communicate between the peers:

```shell
$ ping 2001:db8::b9
PING 2001:db8::b9(2001:db8::b9) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2001:db8::b9: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.07 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::b9: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.36 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::b9: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.20 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::b9: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.10 ms
^C
--- 2001:db8::b9 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.066/1.180/1.361/0.114 ms
```

If you temporarily lose the network connection, the network topology changes etc. it will automatically reconnect. For more information and limitations on proprietary operating systems like macOS, see the [IP VPN reference](#layer-3-ip-overlay-networks). You can also embed the utility in your own application using its [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcip).

### 7. Create a Layer 2 (Ethernet) Overlay Network with `weron vpn ethernet`

If you want more flexibility or work on non-IP networks, the Ethernet VPN is a good choice. It works similarly to `n2n` or ZeroTier. Due to API restrictions, this VPN type [is not available on macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/system-and-kernel-extensions-in-macos-depa5fb8376f/web); use [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/), a computer that respects your freedoms or the layer 3 (IP) VPN instead. To get started, launch the VPN on the first peer:

```shell
$ sudo weron vpn ethernet --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey
{"level":"info","addr":"wss://weron.up.railway.app/","time":"2022-05-06T22:42:10+02:00","message":"Connecting to signaler"}
{"level":"info","id":"fe:60:a5:8b:81:36","time":"2022-05-06T22:42:11+02:00","message":"Connected to signaler"}
```

If you want to add an IP address to the TAP interface, do so with `iproute2` or your OS tools:

```shell
$ sudo ip addr add 192.0.2.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip addr add 2001:db8::1/32 dev tap0
```

On another peer, launch the VPN as well:

```shell
$ sudo weron vpn ethernet --community mycommunity --password mypassword --key mykey
{"level":"info","addr":"wss://weron.up.railway.app/","time":"2022-05-06T22:52:56+02:00","message":"Connecting to signaler"}
{"level":"info","id":"b2:ac:ae:b6:32:8c","time":"2022-05-06T22:52:57+02:00","message":"Connected to signaler"}
{"level":"info","id":"fe:60:a5:8b:81:36","time":"2022-05-06T22:52:57+02:00","message":"Connected to peer"}
```

And add the IP addresses:

```shell
$ sudo ip addr add 192.0.2.2/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip addr add 2001:db8::2/32 dev tap0
```

You can now communicate between the peers:

```shell
$ ping 2001:db8::2
PING 2001:db8::2(2001:db8::2) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2001:db8::2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.20 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.14 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.24 ms
^C
--- 2001:db8::2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.136/1.193/1.239/0.042 ms
```

If you temporarily lose the network connection, the network topology changes etc. it will automatically reconnect. You can also embed the utility in your own application using its [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtceth).

### 8. Write your own protocol with `wrtcconn`

It is almost trivial to build your own distributed applications with weron, similarly to how [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) works. Here is the core logic behind a simple echo example:

```go
// ...
for {
	select {
	case id := <-ids:
		log.Println("Connected to signaler", id)
	case peer := <-adapter.Accept():
		log.Println("Connected to peer", peer.PeerID, "and channel", peer.ChannelID)

		go func() {
			defer func() {
				log.Println("Disconnected from peer", peer.PeerID, "and channel", peer.ChannelID)
			}()

			reader := bufio.NewScanner(peer.Conn)
			for reader.Scan() {
				log.Printf("%s", reader.Bytes())
			}
		}()

		go func() {
			for {
				if _, err := peer.Conn.Write([]byte("Hello!\n")); err != nil {
					return
				}

				time.Sleep(time.Second)
			}
		}()
	}
}
```

You can either use the [minimal adapter](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcconn#Adapter) or the [named adapter](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron/pkg/wrtcconn#NamedAdapter); the latter negotiates a username between the peers, while the former does not check for duplicates. For more information, check out the [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/weron) and take a look at the provided [examples](./examples), utilities and services in the package for examples.

🚀 **That's it!** We hope you enjoy using weron.
